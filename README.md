# PolynomialEvaluator
PolynomialEvaluator is a Java-based toolkit designed to facilitate complex mathematical computations, specifically focusing on polynomial evaluations and numerical analysis methods. 
This repository includes:

Function.java: A class for representing and evaluating polynomial functions up to the 10th degree. It supports calculations at any given point using specified coefficients for each term of the polynomial.
Numerical.java: A class providing methods to numerically solve two fundamental problems in calculus:
Numerical Integration: Implements the trapezoidal rule to estimate the area under a polynomial curve over a specified interval.
Root Finding: Uses the bisection method to determine the roots of a polynomial within a given range, ensuring accuracy up to a specified tolerance.
